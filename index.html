          <h2>Our Community</h2>
          <p>It is important to us that Sever vs Server (SvS) fosters a harassment-free environment. Thus, we have designed the following
              Code of Conduct )CoC) to outline guidelines and expectations that we have for everyone to help us reach
              this. The CoC also formalises repercussions for breaking these guidelines and provides a point of reference
              when dealing with issues that may arise in a community of our size.</p>
          <p>You can find our full CoC below. If you have any questions or concerns, you can leave them here.</p>
          <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.</p>
          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>This CoC applies to the following people:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Staff / organisers</li>

          <h3>SvS Spaces</h3>

          <ul>
              <li>Contact information for any administrators/moderators</li>
              <li>A welcome message with a link to this CoC and the contact information for making an incident report:

          <h3>Additional spaces</h3>
          <h4>Participating Communities</h4>
          <p>In addition to the SvS-managed spaces listed above, individuals within participating communities are held to the CoC. It is the responsibility of moderators of these spaces to uphold these standards.</p>
          <h4>Organisers</h4>
          <p><b>“Organisers”</b> refer to both Event Staff or Partners.</p>
          <p><b>“Event Staff” </b>are members who are directly associated with SvS and are members of any of the following
              teams:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Event Coordination</li>
              <li>Creative and Design</li>

              <li>Moderation</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>“Partners”</b> are those who are directly involved in the organisation of an event, but are not directly
              part of the SvS staff team. These can include: </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Communities/organisations that co-host an event</li>
              <li>Charities</li>
              <li>Sponsors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both kinds of event organisers are expected to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Provide a form of direct contact information to a representative of your organization</li>
              <li>Uphold and enforce the CoC everywhere - whether directly related to SvS or not</li>
              <li>Manage events fairly without bias towards or against any participants / participating communities</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Behaviours</h2>
          <p>Members of the SvS community are expected to be open, considerate, and respectful. The following behaviours
              reinforce these values and contribute to a positive environment:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  Being open. Members of the community are open to collaboration, compromise, and are committed to transparency.
                  Focusing on what is best for the community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we
                  work within them.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Acknowledging time and effort. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that form the foundation of the SvS
                  community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that the labour was often
                  completed simply for the good of the community.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We're receptive to constructive comments and
                  criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
                  Showing empathy towards other community members. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or
                  online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Being considerate. Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other SvS participants.
                  Being respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their
                  efforts.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
                  Using welcoming and inclusive language. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities,
                  fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
                  Holding members of the community accountable to this CoC.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Standards</h2>
          <p>
              Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The SvS community is dedicated to
              providing a positive and welcoming environment and experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity
              and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, religious beliefs,
              or socioeconomic status.
          </p>
          <h3>Inappropriate Behavior</h3>
          <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
          <ul>

              <li>
                  Insults, put-downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, are exclusionary, hold others up for ridicule, or
                  are in any way designed to cause offence to a person based upon their identity
              </li>

          <h2>Enforcement</h2>
          <p>
              If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this CoC, the SvS Moderation team may take action that they
              deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events. The full
              list of consequences for inappropriate behavior is listed in the Enforcement Procedures.
          </p>
          <h3>Enforcement Procedures</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding discrimination, harassment, or any such targeted behaviours that
                  continue after warning/expressions of discontent.
              </li>
              <li>
                  For smaller infractions, up to three warnings will be given, after which proper disciplinary action will be
                  taken.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Participants, staff, and partners who are found violating the CoC will be barred from organizing or competing in
                  future SvS events.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Event moderators will enforce this code regardless of the event. They will work with the Event Organization team
                  and the parties involved to take a fair course of action.
              </li>
          </ul> 
          
          <blockquote>
              If you believe that someone is violating the CoC, or have any other concerns, please either use this anonymous
              form or contact a member of our Event Moderation or Event Staff team immediately.
